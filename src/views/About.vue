						Engram is a site developed to tackle the abstract,
						overwhelming, and disorganized nature of social studies
						using intuitive UI and web design. We experiment with
						how an interactive web interface can enhance historical
						content and contextualize our past within our present.
						As an early-stage edTech start-up, we provide online
						instruction and study notes concentrated on social
						studies education with a focus on AP World History.

					<h1 class="pt-6">Our mission</h1>
					<p class="mb-16">
						This organization's focus on social studies education
						aims to improve the accessibility to knowledge through
						developing new toolsets for students. Compared to other
						subjects, especially STEM subjects, little is being done
						to provide social study students with modern
						applications to improve their learning experiences. It's
						shocking to realize that only 12% of high school seniors
						show proficiency in social studies according to the 2010
						NAEP. While there are a whole slew of systemic issues
						contributing to these results, a major factor of these
						inadequate scores is the way content is traditionally
						delivered. While everyday digital experiences are
						becoming progressively more intuitive, interactive, and
						personalized, secondary education social studies still
						relies predominantly on the use of antiquated textbooks.
						This provides a huge challenge to students of lower
						socioeconomic backgrounds who typically have low reading
						comprehension level are presented with a reading barrier
						even before they are able to learn historical facts.
						Study Bites believes that carefully crafted UI has the
						capacity to present historical information in new and
						diverse ways, making knowledge more accessible to
						everyone.
